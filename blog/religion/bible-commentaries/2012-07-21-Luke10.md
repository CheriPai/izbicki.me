title: exegesis with humility
---

In Luke 10:2, Jesus says:

> <span class=jesus>The harvest is plenty but the workers are few.</span>

I've heard this verse interpreted by churches as a call to evangelism.  There's a lot of lost souls to save, and they won't get saved unless we go out and get them.  But this assumes that I am a "workers" and need to go out to "harvest" the lost souls.  I don't like this interpretation because it lacks humility.

What this verse makes me think about is: "Am I really one of the workers, or am I just slacking off and pretending to work?" Jesus goes on to give very strict commands to his workers: "<span class=jesus>Do not take a purse or bag or sandals.</span>" I like to think I'm trying to live up to this strict command of abandoning everything for Jesus, but it's really hard to figure out what things I need to abandon to make this happen. What completely ordinary---even necessary---things like sandals am I not giving up?
