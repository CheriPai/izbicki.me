title: Miscellaneous files about conscientious objectors
---

This is a collection of government files I have collected concerning the conscientious objector (CO) process in the United States.  Many of these files are outdated; whatever analysis they provide is probably no longer relevant.  They are probably not of interest to you, unless you are doing some serious historical work.

###Department of Defense Regulations
	
  * [DODd-1300.06 (1971)](http://izbicki.me/public/co/DODd-1300.06-1971.pdf) - All changes after this date appear to be trivial.  This regulation is a significant deviation from previous regulations, however, which I do not have copies of.
